This program can be executeted in two ways; one way is to use an input file(input.txt) and getting output from another file(Output.txt) that are prepared and included in the program files or 
interactively by typing inputs at the command line and getting output displayed to the screen. 

To run it using the first option of using files, type 'java StringMatching file' to run the program
To see the output of this program, open the Output.txt file after the program is executed. 
In the output file, the first value is the number of test cases. The remaining lines are the indices at which the given pattern was found in the text.

Note that the input file contains the number of test cases on the first line and text-pattern pairs on the subsequent lines
 
To run the program interactively, type 'StringMatching interactive' and follow the prompts to enter the correct format of the text-pattern pairs. 
In the interactive mode, the program only executes once per run. To try other input combinations, you will have to run the program again(don't compile again)
the interactive way and then enter your new test case.
